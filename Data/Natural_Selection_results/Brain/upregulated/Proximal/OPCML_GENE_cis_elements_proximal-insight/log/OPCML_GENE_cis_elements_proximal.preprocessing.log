4.  combining polymorphism summary with ancestral priors, time 0h0m3s
5.  filtering sites with no variation or ancestral data, time 0h0m3s
    total number of sites:    491
    sites with sequence data: 252
6.  retrieving lambdas and thetas from appropriate genomic blocks, time 0h0m3s
    found 2 total blocks with lambda values.
    found 2 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on lamda.
    found 2 total blocks with theta values.
    found 2 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on theta.
    obtaining intersection bed file
    filtering sites that do not appear in blocks with sufficient information
    number of sites decreased from 252 to 252
