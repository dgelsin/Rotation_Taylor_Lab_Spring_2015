Directory containing additional sample files for INSIGHT-EM
---------------------------------------------------------

   Sample files correspond to various sets of non-coding elements analyzed in Gronau
   et al., 2013. All files correspond to raw polymorphism data before applying the
   frequency cutoff (all polymorphic sites are labeled by 'P'). For each set, 
   one input file describes human polymorphisms and distributions over ancestral
   states for the miRNA sites that pass filtering (labeled *.ins), and another file
   describes human polymorphisms and distributions over ancestral states for the
   neutral flanking polymorphic sites (labeled *.flankPoly.forBetas.ins)

List of datasets:
-----------------
1. GATA2-TFBS  GATA2 transcription factor binding sites
2. lincRNAs    long intergenic non-coding RNAs
3. miRNAs      microRNAs
4. snoRNAs     small nucleolar RNAs
