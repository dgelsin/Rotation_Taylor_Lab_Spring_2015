4.  combining polymorphism summary with ancestral priors, time 0h0m5s
5.  filtering sites with no variation or ancestral data, time 0h0m5s
    total number of sites:    92
    sites with sequence data: 0
6.  retrieving lambdas and thetas from appropriate genomic blocks, time 0h0m5s
    found 0 total blocks with lambda values.
    found 0 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on lamda.
    no sites after filtering for data in flanking neutral sites.
