6.  retrieving lambdas and thetas from appropriate genomic blocks, time 0h0m11s
    found 4 total blocks with lambda values.
    found 4 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on lamda.
    found 4 total blocks with theta values.
    found 4 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on theta.
