Directory containing several sample files for INSIGHT-EM
---------------------------------------------------------

   Sample files correspond to the set of microRNAs analyzed in Gronau et al., 2013.
   One input file describes human polymorphisms and distributions over ancestral
   states for the miRNA sites that pass filtering (labeled *.ins), and another file
   describes human polymorphisms and distributions over ancestral states for the
   neutral flanking polymorphic sites (labeled *.flankPoly.forBetas.ins)

List of directories:
--------------------
   1. baseInput/           contains raw polymorphism data (all polymorphic sites are labeled by 'P')
   2. thresholdedInput/    contains polymorphism data after applying a frequency cutoff of 15% for L/H
   3. output/              empty directory for output files
