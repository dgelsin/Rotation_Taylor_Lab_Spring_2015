4.  combining polymorphism summary with ancestral priors, time 0h0m3s
5.  filtering sites with no variation or ancestral data, time 0h0m3s
    total number of sites:    611
    sites with sequence data: 325
6.  retrieving lambdas and thetas from appropriate genomic blocks, time 0h0m3s
    found 2 total blocks with lambda values.
    found 2 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on lamda.
    found 2 total blocks with theta values.
    found 2 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on theta.
