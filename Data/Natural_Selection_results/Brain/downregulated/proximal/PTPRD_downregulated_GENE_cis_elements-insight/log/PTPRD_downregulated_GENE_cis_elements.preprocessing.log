5.  filtering sites with no variation or ancestral data, time 0h0m13s
    total number of sites:    662
    sites with sequence data: 444
6.  retrieving lambdas and thetas from appropriate genomic blocks, time 0h0m13s
    found 3 total blocks with lambda values.
    found 3 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on lamda.
    found 3 total blocks with theta values.
    found 3 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on theta.
