    total number of sites:    931
    sites with sequence data: 692
6.  retrieving lambdas and thetas from appropriate genomic blocks, time 0h0m1s
    found 5 total blocks with lambda values.
    found 5 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on lamda.
    found 5 total blocks with theta values.
    found 5 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on theta.
