5.  filtering sites with no variation or ancestral data, time 0h0m14s
    total number of sites:    188
    sites with sequence data: 0
6.  retrieving lambdas and thetas from appropriate genomic blocks, time 0h0m14s

    found 0 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on lamda.
    no sites after filtering for data in flanking neutral sites.
