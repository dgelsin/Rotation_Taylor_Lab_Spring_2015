Step 1: Data summary for analysis:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The data summary file NSF_downregulated_GENE_cis_elements.data.summary.txt looks like this:

                X	initial number of sites, with redundancies
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
               F1	non-autosomal
               F2	redundant or filtered due to genomic filtering
               F3	no polymorphism data or insufficient outgroup sequence data
               F4	no sufficient data from flanking neutral sites
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Y	final, non-redundant, after all filtering

	       X   indicates the number of nucleotide positions in input set (with multiple counts for redundant instances)
          Y   indicates the number of nucleotide positions analyzed, after applying all filters, and counting each
              unique position once
        F1-F4 indicate the number of nucleotide positions covered by one of our filters. Filters are described
              in cumulative form, such that Y = X-F1-F2-F3-F4.
        
Step 2: Insufficient data for analysis:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If number of sites after filtering (Y) is 0, then analysis is not further pursued,
        and file NSF_downregulated_GENE_cis_elements.insight.results.txt contains the following message:
        'No sites remained after filtering. See log/NSF_downregulated_GENE_cis_elements.preprocessing.log'
        A similar message appears if the number of flanking neutral polymorphic sites is insufficient
        for reliable estimation of beta1 and beta3.

Step 3: Graphical summary of results:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The graphical summary is shown in file NSF_downregulated_GENE_cis_elements.insight.results.pdf.
        The plot contains three bars for E[Pw], rho, and E[Dp] (in that order).
        The left axis provides the scale for rho, and the right axis provides the scale of the expected
        counts E[Pw] and E[Dp] (scaled per kbp). The estimates are shown with the curvature-based standard
        errors, and below each bar corresponding to a value that is significantly greater than zero (with
        p<0.01) there is a significance indicator in red ('*' for rho, 'w' for E[Pw], and 'p' for E[Dp]).
        Significance is assessed using the appropriate LRT, using a chi-squared distribution with
        three degrees of freedom for rho, and one degree of freedom for gamma (E[Pw]) and eta (E[Dp]).


Step 4: Textual summary of results:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The textual summary is shown in file NSF_downregulated_GENE_cis_elements.insight.results.txt.
        The result line lists estimates and curvature-based standard errors for
        rho, E[Dp], E[Pw], alpha, tau, eta, and gamma (alpha and tau are the fractions of divergences
        / polymorphisms under positive / weak negative selection, respectively). Additionally, the
        log-likelihood of the MLE is also given, and the LRT statistics for rho>0, eta>0, and gamma>0
        (the LRT statistics is twice the difference between the log-likelihood of the MLE and the log
        likelihood of the restricted solution). The last entry of the results line indicates the status
        of the four INSIGHT-EM runs: main run, run with rho=0, run with eta=0, run with gamma=0. If these
        have not converged, consult with the INSIGHT-EM user manual (see downloads in INSIGHT website
        http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/INSIGHT/).


Step 5: Posterior probability table:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The posterior probability table is given in file emOutput/NSF_downregulated_GENE_cis_elements.post.sites.
        The table contains the following columns:
        - site     - id of the site, as given in the EM input file (contains information on chromosome position)
        - NoDiv    - Probability site is monomorphic non-divergent
                     (NoDiv = NoDiv_N + NoDiv_S)
        - NoDiv_N  - Probability site is monomorphic non-divergent and neutral
        - NoDiv_S  - Probability site is monomorphic non-divergent and under selection
        - Div      - Probability site is monomorphic divergent
                     (Div = Div_N + Div_S)
                     (NoDiv + Div = 1 for M sites)
        - Div_N    - Probability site is monomorphic divergent and neutral
        - Div_S    - Probability site is monomorphic divergent and under selection
        - Poly     - Probability site is polymorphic
                     (Poly = 1 for L and H sites)
        - PolyL_N  - Probability site is polymorphic, with low derived allele frequency (<f) and neutral
        - PolyH1_N - Probability site is polymorphic, with intermediate derived allele frequency ( in [f,1-f]) and neutral
        - PolyH2_N - Probability site is polymorphic, with high derived allele frequency (>1-f) and neutral
        - PolyL_S  - Probability site is polymorphic, with low derived allele frequency (<f) and under selection
                     (PolyL_N + PolyH2_N + PolyL_S = 1 for L sites and PolyH1_N = 1 for H sites)

Step 6: Follow-up analysis:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        INSIGHT provides the framework to quickly refine the analysis by analyzing subsets of the data,
        considering alternative thresholds for L/H polymorphic sites, etc. These can be achieved by
        downloading an updated version of INSIGHT-EM and accompanying scripts from the INSIGHT website
        (http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/INSIGHT/), and re-running the EM on the EM input files computed
        as part of this analysis. The INSIGHT-EM user manual provides more information and examples.
        This approach avoids the time consuming step of computing the EM input file for each variant of
        the analysis.
