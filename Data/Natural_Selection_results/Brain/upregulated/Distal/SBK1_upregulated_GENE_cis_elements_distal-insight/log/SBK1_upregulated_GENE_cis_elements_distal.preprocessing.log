6.  retrieving lambdas and thetas from appropriate genomic blocks, time 0h0m5s
    found 5 total blocks with lambda values.
    found 5 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on lamda.
    found 5 total blocks with theta values.
    found 5 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on theta.
