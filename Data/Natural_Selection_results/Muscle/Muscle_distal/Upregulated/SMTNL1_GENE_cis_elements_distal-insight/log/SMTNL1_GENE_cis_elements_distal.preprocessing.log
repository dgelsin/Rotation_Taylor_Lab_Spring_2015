    total number of sites:    2175
    sites with sequence data: 1878
6.  retrieving lambdas and thetas from appropriate genomic blocks, time 0h0m3s
    found 10 total blocks with lambda values.
    found 10 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on lamda.
    found 10 total blocks with theta values.
    found 10 blocks with at least 100 sites with information on theta.
